# Food Delivery Analysis
A prediction model for food re-ordering is a specialized algorithm designed to anticipate when and what food items a customer would reorder based on historical ordering data and other relevant factors.

Using a dataset from Kaggle that was based on a survey, this dataset focuses on the Bangalore region of India's food delivery customers.

With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasâ€™nt been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day. Inspite of increasing demand it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants.

With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location, the availability of restaurants who deliver, the possibility of re-ordering and so on. 

With many factors in play, this food delivery model was based on Random Forest Classifier after cross validation to calculate the most important fields that affect re-ordering.

Some important factors after cross validation were  
More restaurant choices, Easy Payment option, More Offers and Discount, Good Food quality, Good Tracking system among a few others.

The model has a 93.4% accuracy rate.
